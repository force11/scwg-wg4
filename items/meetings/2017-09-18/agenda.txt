Headsets (+ mic) are recommended for the call unless, of course, you are
calling in by phone. If this is your first time using Zoom, be sure to
give ample time to download the Zoom client before the call (~200MB
download). I can look into the possibility of an additional SIP option
if that would work better for any.

As always, these calls are open. Anyone is welcome to join these weekly calls
at any time.

If you want to add anything to or modify the proposed agenda below,
please respond via the mailing list, Google Doc agenda (below), or make
a note of it at the beginning of the call.
