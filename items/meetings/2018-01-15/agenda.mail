Subject: [AGENDA] SCWG WG4 Weekly Call - 15 January 2018 8am PST

Hi all,

Here is the info for the next weekly meeting of the SCWG WG4. Despite the
holiday in the US, I think it would be prudent to meet to try to finish our
preparations for the Knowen call on the 22nd.

Monday, January 15th
Time: 8am Pacific, 11am Boston, 16:00 UTC, 17:00 CET, 18:00 EET

Text Chat: CommonsPatterns Slack (#tech-meetings channel)

           invite here: https://limitless-island-44565.herokuapp.com/
Voice: tel:+1-646-558-8656, Meeting ID: 489-033-2111
       international numbers: https://goo.gl/6wqeoA
       https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/489-033-2111
Duration: 60 minutes

Headsets (+ mic) are recommended for the call unless, of course, you are
calling in by phone. If this is your first time using Zoom, be sure to give
ample time to download the Zoom client before the call (~200MB download for
some platforms). I can look into the possibility of an additional SIP option
if that would work better for any.

As always, these calls are open. Anyone is welcome to join these weekly calls
at any time.

If you want to add anything to or modify the proposed agenda below,
please respond via the mailing list, Google Doc agenda (below), or make
a note of it at the beginning of the call during the agenda review.
