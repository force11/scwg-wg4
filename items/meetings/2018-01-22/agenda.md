We had planned for this call to be the first of the invited topics discussions
(on Knowen). However, through some discussion with Ivar this week it seemed
more advantageous to postpone that call until the next week (the 29th), and use
the meeting this Monday, instead of discussing Knowen, to work together on how
we should approach the larger group(s), including the wording of the invite to
the SCWG group and several additions to the group's pages on force11.org. This
would allow more time for others to prepare for this topic, and will help us to
know that we're all on the same page with how we're approaching this project.

I hope that this change of plans is okay with everyone. I think we would end up
with a better call this way, and a better start to this project. Thank you!
