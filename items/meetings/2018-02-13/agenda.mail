Headsets (+ mic) are recommended for the call unless, of course, you are
calling in by phone. If this is your first time using Zoom, be sure to
give ample time to download the Zoom client before the call (~200MB
download depending on the platform). I can look into the possibility of
an additional SIP option if that would work better for any.

As always, these calls are open. Anyone is welcome to join these weekly
