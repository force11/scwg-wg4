In thinking of the discussion during the call last week, I am convinced that we
need a clearer understanding of what we're about with the topics project. A few
ideas have coalesced in my mind during that past week that may help us to come
to a better understanding of what we're trying to achieve and how this project
fits into the bigger picture.

# Proposed Agenda

1. Agenda review
2. Introductions to new people
3. Status of current action items
    - Working on the structure of the Knowen doc
4. Our goal and how we can productively work towards it
    - A vision of defining the scholarly commons and how the topics project
    fits within it (patterns, forces, and front doors).
5. Topics project
    - Form/structure for topic analysis
    - Continuing discussion on Knowen (see analysis doc here:
