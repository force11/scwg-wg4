Last week we took a deep dive into some design theory. While I do think it is a
useful perspective to look at what we're doing, I apologize if the point of the
exercise wasn't very clear. This week as we finish up our analysis of Knowen,
I'm hoping that the point will become more clear.

In March we will be looking at some ideas that Rowan Cockett and Lindsey Heagy
have been working about a component-based approach to researching. Rowan has
already shared a blog post to get us thinking about this topic:
