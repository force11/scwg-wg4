Last week we wrapped up our dedicated analysis of Knowen, though there are
still many things left to understand about how we go about this process. Keep
the ideas coming! Part of our group's purpose is to come to a better
understanding (and practice) of how to do this. Eventually all of our analysis
needs to be connected in some cohesive, meaningful way.

For the topics project this month we will be looking at some ideas that Rowan
Cockett and Lindsey Heagy have been working on:
[Geosci.xyz](http://geosci.xyz). If any of you have time to look at this before
the call, that would be helpful. If not, we'll be looking at it during the call
tomorrow. I've started a new (blank) Google Doc to start gathering our
thoughts: <%=

%>.

I have also sketched our current thinking on how the process will go in general
as we look at each of these topics: <%=

very welcome. ;-)
