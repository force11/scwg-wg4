Subject: [AGENDA] SCWG WG4 Weekly Call - Tuesday, March 13th, 2018 15:00 UTC

Hi all,

We will be pleased to have Rowan Cockett and Lindsey Heagy on this call
to learn about the scholarly commons through some of the work they have
been doing in geoscience (Geosci.xyz).

This topic incorporates ideas about the creation and reuse of
educational resources made from extensible, imported components and
various approaches to peer review, testing, reproducibility, and
collaboration that they have developed over time as the need arose,
leveraging technologies such as Python, Sphinx, and Jupyter Notebooks.
For a brief introduction to these ideas, you are encouraged to watch
this presentation by Lindsey from SciPy 2016:
