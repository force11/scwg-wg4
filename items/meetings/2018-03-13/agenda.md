We will be pleased to have Rowan Cockett and Lindsey Heagy on this call to
learn about the scholarly commons through some of the work they have been doing
in geoscience ([Geosci.xyz](http://geosci.xyz)).

This topic incorporates ideas about the creation and reuse of educational
resources made from extensible, imported components and various approaches to
peer review, testing, reproducibility, and collaboration that they have
developed over time as the need arose, leveraging technologies such as Python,
Sphinx, and Jupyter Notebooks. For a brief introduction to these ideas, you are
encouraged to watch this presentation by Lindsey from SciPy 2016:
