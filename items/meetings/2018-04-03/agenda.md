We don't have a specific invited topic for this month, so I'm proposing that we
address some scattered thoughts and take time to tighten our mainstay before
broadening our journey.

We have experienced discussions around two topics up to this point. Several
future discussion topics are in the works and we have many good prospective
topics for the future. What have we learned about this mode of inquiry? Has
anything in particular stood out as being critically important in our approach?
What could we do better?
