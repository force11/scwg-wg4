I apologize for the late agenda. My kids have been on break from school this
past week and I joined them for a needed break from work. I'm excited to get
back into this. ;-D

This week we will try to solidify some aspects of the topics project based on
our discussion last week and thoughts that have or will emerge from preparing a
blog post about the topics project. If anyone has any additional ideas, please
bring them to the table and we can discuss them. I want to make this the best
thing that we can, so don't hesitate to share your ideas.

I have started putting down a few thoughts that I think are most crucial about
the topics project for the blog post here:

You're welcome to add your own perspectives if you get a chance before the
call. You will also have a chance to discuss the post during and after the call
as well, so don't worry if you don't have a chance to contribute beforehand.

Thank you!
