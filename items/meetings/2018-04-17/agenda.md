I have worked through some more thinking on the blog post here:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gm7-TftBb1b4umM-uNIImqrmJNW9v1zRqy7490HuPgs/edit

I have borrowed thoughts from the progress narrative document that we worked on
a while ago, and I think I'm leaning more and more towards this being a light,
actionable piece, not a philosophical treatise. ;-)

Thank you, and apologies again for getting this agenda out so late!

1. Agenda review
2. Introductions to new people
3. Status of current action items

    it together]

    assignments https://goo.gl/nLmfj4]
4. Topics Project: tighten our mainstay

    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gm7-TftBb1b4umM-uNIImqrmJNW9v1zRqy7490HuPgs/edit
    - Letter of invitation: it would be good to create an invitation template
    that could be adapted for specific invitees
