Thank you everyone for your help preparing the submission for FORCE2018.

I'm proposing that we spend the next couple weeks finishing up loose ends such
as finishing the plan for the blog post(s), work on the website, etc.

# Proposed Agenda

1. Agenda review
2. Introductions to new people
3. Status of current action items
    - FORCE2018 submission - question from the steering committee: are we okay
    to make it open?
    - Continue working on the blog post
        - Serialize the blog post thoughts and add titles to each installment
        [Chris - NOT YET DONE - will try to have something by tomorrow]
        - Contemplate and capture the questions we should be asking about
        channels/methods of publishing/disseminating it. What should this look
        like for the Scholarly Commons? What is needed?
    - Topic schedule
        - SciPost scheduled to start May 29th (is everything go for that Ivar?)
        - Linked Research/Sarven Capadisli after that (yet to be firmly
        scheduled, but sometime in June or July).
4. Topics Project: tighten our mainstay
    - Blog post for FORCE11 site:
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gm7-TftBb1b4umM-uNIImqrmJNW9v1zRqy7490HuPgs/edit
6. Action items and suggestions for next week's agenda
7. Post call summary and wrap-up
