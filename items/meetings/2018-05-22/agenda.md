The main thing for this meeting is to touch base with the progress on the blog
post and to prep for the SciPost discussion next week.

# Proposed Agenda

1. Agenda review
2. Introductions to new people
3. Status of current action items
    - Continue working on the blog post
        - Condense our discussion into the beginning of a blog post or blog
        post installment, with the goal of publishing at least the first
        installment before the SciPost discussion topic on May 29th. [IN SLOW
        PROGRESS ;-)]
4. Topics Project: tighten our mainstay
    - Blog post for FORCE11 site:
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gm7-TftBb1b4umM-uNIImqrmJNW9v1zRqy7490HuPgs/edit
        - Contemplate and capture the questions we should be asking about
        channels/methods of publishing/disseminating it. What should this look
        like for the Scholarly Commons? What is needed?
    - Intro to SciPost
6. Action items and suggestions for next week's agenda
7. Post call summary and wrap-up
