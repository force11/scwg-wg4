For the topics project over the next few weeks we will be looking at one of the
projects we seek to understand within the broader theme of emerging publishing
technologies. We will be pleased to have Jean-Sébastien Caux and Jasper van
Wezel help us learn more about the Scholarly Commons through some of the work
they have been doing with SciPost.

I invite you to look over SciPost (https://scipost.org) and add any thoughts or
questions that you may have to the SciPost document before the call:
