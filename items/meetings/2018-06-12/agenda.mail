Subject: [AGENDA] SCWG WG4 Weekly Call - Tuesday, June 12th, 2018 15:00 UTC

Hi all,

This week we will _actually_ continue the discussion that we started two
weeks ago on SciPost (I cancelled the meeting last week because of a few
of us had conflicts). Thank you to everyone that has been willing to
forge ahead on this stuff during these summer months. I know it is a
crazy time to meet for many, but we have so much to cover! If I can do
anything to make it easier for anyone, please let me know.

I invite you to look over SciPost (https://scipost.org) and add any
thoughts or questions that you may have to the SciPost document before
the call: https://goo.gl/2Grdow



PROPOSED AGENDA


1.  Agenda review
2.  Introductions to new people
3.  Invited topic: SciPost (discussion)
    -   General discussion on the commons and perspectives on what we
        can learn about scholarly commons from this topic. Feel free to
        add thoughts or questions to the discussion document:

Headsets (+ mic) are recommended for the call unless, of course, you are

an additional SIP option if that would work better for any.
