This week we will _actually_ continue the discussion that we started two weeks
ago on SciPost (I cancelled the meeting last week because of a few of us had
conflicts). Thank you to everyone that has been willing to forge ahead on this
stuff during these summer months. I know it is a crazy time to meet for many,
but we have so much to cover! If I can do anything to make it easier for
anyone, please let me know.

I invite you to look over SciPost (https://scipost.org) and add any thoughts or
questions that you may have to the SciPost document before the call:
