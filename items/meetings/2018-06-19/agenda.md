This week we will follow-up with Jean-SÃ©bastien Caux for some deeper probing of
the rationale and goals behind SciPost, in hopes that we can better understand
what is needed for the Scholarly Commons. So bring all of your hard questions!

I invite you to look over SciPost (https://scipost.org) and add any thoughts or
questions that you may have to the SciPost document before the call:
