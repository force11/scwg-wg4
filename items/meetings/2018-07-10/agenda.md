The topic that we will be exploring next is Linked Research, an initiative
started by Sarven Capadisli and Amy Guy. As this is an initiative and not a
concrete project, I have given Sarven a lot of leeway into what he wants to
share, and we may end up covering several projects and sub-projects.

This week is our preparatory call, so bring all your questions and thoughts to
the discussion. I've started a Google Doc for the analysis of this topic here:
