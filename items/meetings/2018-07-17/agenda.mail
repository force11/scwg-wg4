Subject: [AGENDA] SCWG WG4 Weekly Call - Tuesday, July 17th, 2018 15:00 UTC

Hi all,

We will be pleased to have Sarven Capadisli on this call to learn more
about the Scholarly Commons through the work that he and Amy Guy have
done with Linked Research. As this is an initiative and not a concrete
project, I have given Sarven a lot of leeway into what he wants to
share, and we may end up covering several projects and sub-projects.

Herbert Van de Sompel gave probably the most accessible introduction to
these ideas during his CNI lecture last year. You can watch it here:

Please bring your questions and thoughts to the discussion. The Google
Doc for the analysis of this topic is here: https://goo.gl/dx8LPM.
