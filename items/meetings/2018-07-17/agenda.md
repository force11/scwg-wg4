We will be pleased to have Sarven Capadisli on this call to learn more about
the Scholarly Commons through the work that he and Amy Guy have done with
Linked Research. As this is an initiative and not a concrete project, I have
given Sarven a lot of leeway into what he wants to share, and we may end up
covering several projects and sub-projects.

Herbert Van de Sompel gave probably the most accessible introduction to these
ideas during his CNI lecture last year. You can watch it here:

Please bring your questions and thoughts to the discussion. The Google Doc for
the analysis of this topic is here: <%=
