Subject: [AGENDA] SCWG WG4 Weekly Call - Tuesday, August 14th, 2018 15:00 UTC

Hi all,

We will be pleased to have Jeff Magee on this call to talk with us about
his project Claimspace and share his vision and motivations behind it.
This will be followed by some questions and general discussion.

Claimspace is a network of sites published in a new format called Claim.
Claim describes reasoning rather than presentation, allowing experts to
maintain continuous maps of knowledge that span across individuals,
organizations and disciplines. For more information, please watch this
short introduction to the topic: https://www.claimspace.org/vision.

Please bring your questions and thoughts to the discussion. The Google
Doc for the analysis of this topic is here: https://goo.gl/RMAvH5.
