We will be pleased to have Jeff Magee on this call to talk with us about his
project Claimspace and share his vision and motivations behind it. This will be
followed by some questions and general discussion.

Claimspace is a network of sites published in a new format called Claim. Claim
describes reasoning rather than presentation, allowing experts to maintain
continuous maps of knowledge that span across individuals, organizations and
disciplines. For more information, please watch this short introduction to the
topic: https://www.claimspace.org/vision.

Please bring your questions and thoughts to the discussion. The Google Doc for
