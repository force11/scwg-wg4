Sorry for the late invite!

I hope that everyone had a safe week. To dig a little deeper this week into the
specifics of how to move forward, I'm proposing that we use GitHub issues to
organize our discussion and to more easily track concrete proposals and tasks.

# Proposed Agenda

1. Agenda review
2. Introductions to new people
3. Status of current action items
    - Come up with a more detailed proposal for how to answer the responses in
      the structuring our knowledge document [CHRIS and KATIE]
    - Begin to extract some understanding as to what types of tools might be
      required for scholarly commons [DAVID]
4. Our goal and how we can productively work towards it
    - Structuring our knowledge: <%=
