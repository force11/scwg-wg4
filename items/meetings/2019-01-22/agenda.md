Happy new year everyone! I am so excited to start back up and move forward with
the Scholarly Commons. Thank you to all that have been involved in this helping
to bring this about. Even if you are here only to show your support for this
effort, thank you for being a member of this group.

Before the break we took some time as a group to reflect on future directions.
I'd love to take some time this next week to take a step back and revisit that
discussion and make some plans for moving forward together.

Here is an agenda, and like always, feel free to add your own suggestions for
discussion.
