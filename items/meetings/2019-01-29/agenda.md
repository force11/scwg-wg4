Here is the invite for this week, at the regular time. I am planning on sending
out a poll over the next few weeks to revisit the meeting time. I want to be
sure as many people are able to join us as would like to. We are still working
on alternative ways to participate---thanks for your patience, as the answer as
to how to do this is not trivial.

# Proposed Agenda

2. Introductions to new people
3. Status of (prior) action items
