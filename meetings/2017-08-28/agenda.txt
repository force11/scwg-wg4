Subject: [AGENDA] SCWG WG4 Weekly Call - 28 August 2017 8am PDT

Hi all,

I am still hoping to get these out earlier, but here is the info for the
next weekly meeting of the SCWG WG4:

Monday, August 28st
Time: 8am Pacific, 11am Boston, 15:00 UTC, 17:00 CEST
      other time zones: https://goo.gl/ivBMBe
Text Chat: (Details will be forthcoming)
Voice: tel:+1-646-558-8656, Meeting ID: 489-033-2111
       international numbers: https://goo.gl/6wqeoA
       https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/489-033-2111
Duration: 60 minutes
Scribes: [we'll talk more about this below]

Headsets (+ mic) are recommended for the call unless, of course, you are
calling in by phone. If this is your first time using Zoom, be sure to
give ample time to download the Zoom client before the call (~200MB
download). I can look into the possibility of an additional SIP option
if that would work better for any.

As always, anyone is welcome to join these weekly calls at any time.

If you want to add anything to or modify the proposed agenda below,
please respond via the mailing list, Google Doc agenda (below), or make
a note of it at the beginning of the call.
